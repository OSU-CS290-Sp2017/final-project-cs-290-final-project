    "body": "I've upgraded the processor in my computer and I no longer need the old one. It's in great condition; it runs just as well as it did the first day out of the box. Theres a bit of wear on the front plate from wiping off thermal paste several times, but it's just superficial damage. It doesn't affect the performance at all. The CPU has 4 cores and 8 threads, clocks at base 3.5 GHz, boosts up to 3.9 GHz. I've been able to overclock it up to 4.5 GHz, but if you do that, you're probably going to need water cooling.",

There is, however, a bit of scarring on the front plate as a result of having to use a screwdriver to pry it open.",
