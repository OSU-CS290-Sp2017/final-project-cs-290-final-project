			<h4><strong>Is this a functional website?</strong></h4>
			<p>
				That really depends on what you consider "functional." Does it work?<br>
				Sure, I guess. You can post your own ads, look at existing ones, and<br>
				navigate through the dynamically rendered site. There's also search<br>
				functionality. How fun is that! On a serious note, no, this isn't<br>
				a real website, just a fun project that I got to work on by myself.
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<h4><strong>How long did this site take you to make?</strong></h4>
			<p>
				I'm not really sure exactly how long it took me, since I didn't have<br>
				a timer running or anything. If I had to guess, I would say around<br>
				25 hours. A better way of putting it, I think, is that it took me a<br>
				whole weekend to complete.
			</p>

			<h4><strong>Just exactly how much fun did you have making this site?</strong></h4>
			<p>
				More fun that your mind could possibly comprehend. In all honesty, I<br>
				<strong><em>love</em></strong> working with HTML, CSS, and JS. Handlebars and node.js on the<br>
				other hand, are a pain in the ass, but I enjoyed learning more about<br>
				them and how they work. Being able to serve dynamically rendered web<br>
				pages to a real server (even if the server is just localhost), was a<br>
				really interesting learning experience.
